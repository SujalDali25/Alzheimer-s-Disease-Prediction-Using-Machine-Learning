# Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

A comprehensive study on Alzheimer’s Disease prediction using machine learning based on medical history parameters.

## 📑 Project Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for the early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using medical history data. By leveraging robust feature selection, comparative model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, the study aims to improve predictive accuracy and efficiency over traditional diagnostic methods.
